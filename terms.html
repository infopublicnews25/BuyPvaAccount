        <strong>Important:</strong> This page is general information and not legal advice. By using BuyPvaAccount (the “Site”), you agree to these Terms.
      </div>

      <h2>1) Service provided “as-is”</h2>
      <p>The Site and any products/services are provided on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis. We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability, error-free operation, or that content will always be accurate or up to date.</p>

      <h2>2) No warranties</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all warranties—express or implied—including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

      <h2>3) Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, BuyPvaAccount, its operators, and suppliers will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages arising from or related to your use of the Site, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
      <p>If liability cannot be excluded, our total liability for any claim will not exceed the amount you paid for the specific order giving rise to the claim.</p>

      <h2>4) Third‑party links</h2>
      <p>The Site may link to third‑party websites or services for convenience (for example, payment providers). We do not control these third parties and are not responsible for their content, policies, or practices. Your use of third‑party services is at your own risk and subject to their terms.</p>

      <h2>5) Customer responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for keeping your devices, accounts, credentials, and access links secure.</li>
        <li>You must provide accurate contact and order details.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for complying with all laws and the rules/policies of any external platforms you use.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6) Acceptable use (strict rules)</h2>
      <p>You agree not to use the Site or any purchased items for unlawful activity, harassment, abusive behavior, or to violate the rules of other services. We do not support misuse including spam, unsolicited messaging, or attempts to evade platform protections.</p>
      <p>If we detect or reasonably suspect prohibited use, fraud, or abuse, we may refuse service and/or deny refund/replacement requests.</p>

      <h2>7) Support, replacement, and refund windows</h2>
      <p>Where a warranty/replacement period is stated on a product page or delivery page, it applies only within that period starting from purchase (or delivery timestamp). After that window, the item is considered accepted.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To request help, you must create a support ticket within the stated window and include clear details (order ID, issue description, and evidence if requested).</li>
        <li>We may deny refund/replacement if the product was used beyond reasonable verification, altered, shared, resold, or handled in a way that prevents verification.</li>
        <li>We may require basic troubleshooting steps before approving any remedy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8) Payments and crypto notices</h2>
      <p>If you pay using cryptocurrency or third‑party processors, you are responsible for sending the correct amount to the correct address/network and following provider instructions. Blockchain transactions may be irreversible.</p>
      <p>Where refunds are approved, refunds are processed to the extent feasible using the same payment method/asset originally received, subject to provider limitations and compliance requirements.</p>

      <h2>9) Anti‑fraud and compliance</h2>
      <p>We may delay, hold, cancel, or refuse orders if we reasonably suspect fraud, chargeback risk, money laundering, or other prohibited activity. We may request additional verification and may cooperate with lawful requests from competent authorities.</p>

      <h2>10) Delivery links and retention</h2>
      <p>Delivery links and downloadable materials may be available for a limited time. You are responsible for saving delivered items promptly and keeping delivery links private. Anyone with access to a delivery link may be able to view the contents.</p>

      <h2>11) Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time by posting a revised version on this page. The “Last updated” date indicates when changes were made. Continued use of the Site after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

      <h2>12) Contact</h2>
      <p>For questions about these Terms, contact support using the Site support/ticket options or email if provided on the Site.</p>

      <h2>Need help?</h2>
